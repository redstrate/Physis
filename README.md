# Physis

Physis is a library for reading and writing FFXIV data. It knows how to read many of the game's formats, and can write some of them too.

## Supported Game Versions

All game versions are supported, including benchmark versions of the game. Only the Windows client data is tested and other platforms probably won't work.

## Supported Platforms

Physis compiles and runs on all major platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux and WebAssembly.

## Usage

Physis exposes it's API in a few different languages:

### Rust

If you want to use Physis in your Rust project, you can simply add it as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
physis = "0.4"
```

Documentation is available online at [docs.xiv.zone](https://docs.xiv.zone/docs/physis). It's automatically updated as new
commits are pushed to the main branch.

### C/C++

C/C++ projects (or any language that can interface with C) can use [libphysis](https://github.com/redstrate/libphysis).

### C#

C# projects can use [PhysisSharp](https://github.com/redstrate/PhysisSharp) which exposes part of the Physis API to C#.

## Building

You need to set up [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and then run `cargo build`. Although Physis is a library, we have a few examples you can run.

## Contributing & Support

Feel free to submit patches to help fix bugs or add functionality. Filing issues is appreciated, but I do this in my free time so please don't expect professional support.

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about contributing back to the project!
